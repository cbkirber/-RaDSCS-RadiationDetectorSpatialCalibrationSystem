--Project Summary--
Germanium based gamma radiation detectors can have a variable response based on where in the detector a gamma ray strikes. Unfortunately these detectors do not have much spatial resolution so this variation in response can't be accounted for in postprocessing of data. My team developed a product capable of spatially mapping the variation in detector response. By doing so the overall error in data collection from radiation detectors can be minimized.

--My Contribution--
My primary contribution was designing and building the positioning system for this project. This system needed to be capable of autonomously positioning a 50lbs block of lead in a 2D plain with accuracy of at least 0.5mm. The primary skills I utilized to achieve this were AutoCAD drafting, metal machining, and critical thinking. 

I also made the majority of the figures in the Collimator and Positioning System sections of the Final Presentation.

--CADModels--
This folder contains all CAD related work done by me for this project. MOST OF THESE MODELS WERE MADE FOR DIMENSIONAL TESTING PURPOSES ONLY!!! As a resulst they may be lacking some detail that you would expect from a model meant for printing.
